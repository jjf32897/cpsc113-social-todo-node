#Jo-Jo Feng's CPSC113 Social Todo App (a.k.a. DoGether &#128588;)

This is a collaborative todo application based on Kyle's starter code.

This application lives at http://dogether-yale.herokuapp.com.

#How to use this application

On the homepage, users can access a registration form by clicking the "Need an
account?" button or log in by using the form below "Sign in to see your tasks."

Upon registering or logging in, the user will be greeted by name and be able to
view their tasks (or be informed if they have no tasks to show). A "+ Task"
button will be available at the top of the page and upon clicking it, a form
will drop down that can be filled out to create a task.

Tasks can be shared with other collaborators (by email). Tasks that you own or
are a collaborator on will be displayed with a "Complete" and "Delete" button,
but the latter will only appear if the current user is the owner of the task.

Tasks can be completed by any collaborator, and tasks will be crossed out (and
emoji'd) when completed. When a task is completed, an email will be sent to all
collaborators. Completed task can have their completion status be undone.
